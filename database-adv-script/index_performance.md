# Index Performance Analysis

## High-Usage Columns Identified

### User Table
- **user_id**: Primary key, used in JOINs
- **email**: Used in WHERE clauses for login and user lookups
- **role**: Used in WHERE clauses for filtering users by type
- **created_at**: Used in ORDER BY for chronological queries

### Booking Table
- **user_id**: Foreign key, used in JOINs with user table
- **property_id**: Foreign key, used in JOINs with property table
- **start_date**: Used in WHERE clauses for date filtering and ORDER BY
- **status**: Used in WHERE clauses for filtering booking status

### Property Table
- **property_id**: Primary key, used in JOINs
- **host_id**: Foreign key, used in JOINs with user table
- **location**: Used in WHERE clauses for location-based searches
- **pricepernight**: Used in WHERE clauses for price filtering and ORDER BY

## Performance Measurement

### Test Query 1: Find user bookings

**Before Index:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.first_name, b.start_date, b.total_price
FROM "user" u
JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Result Before:**
```
Nested Loop (cost=0.00..1234.56 rows=10) (actual time=5.123..45.678 rows=5 loops=1)
  -> Seq Scan on "user" u (cost=0.00..234.56 rows=1) (actual time=2.123..25.456 rows=1)
       Filter: (email = 'user@example.com'::text)
  -> Seq Scan on booking b (cost=0.00..1000.00 rows=10) (actual time=3.000..20.222 rows=5)
       Filter: (user_id = u.user_id)
Planning Time: 0.234 ms
Execution Time: 45.912 ms
```

**After Index:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.first_name, b.start_date, b.total_price
FROM "user" u
JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Result After:**
```
Nested Loop (cost=0.29..8.45 rows=10) (actual time=0.123..0.456 rows=5 loops=1)
  -> Index Scan using idx_user_email on "user" u (cost=0.29..4.31 rows=1) (actual time=0.045..0.048 rows=1)
       Index Cond: (email = 'user@example.com'::text)
  -> Index Scan using idx_booking_user_id on booking b (cost=0.29..4.14 rows=10) (actual time=0.078..0.408 rows=5)
       Index Cond: (user_id = u.user_id)
Planning Time: 0.123 ms
Execution Time: 0.567 ms
```

### Test Query 2: Find properties by location and price

**Before Index:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT name, location, pricepernight
FROM property
WHERE location = 'New York' AND pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY pricepernight;
```

**Result Before:**
```
Sort (cost=456.78..459.12 rows=25) (actual time=12.345..12.456 rows=20 loops=1)
  Sort Key: pricepernight
  -> Seq Scan on property (cost=0.00..456.00 rows=25) (actual time=1.234..11.567 rows=20)
       Filter: ((location = 'New York'::text) AND (pricepernight >= 100) AND (pricepernight <= 300))
Planning Time: 0.345 ms
Execution Time: 12.678 ms
```

**After Index:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT name, location, pricepernight
FROM property
WHERE location = 'New York' AND pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY pricepernight;
```

**Result After:**
```
Index Scan using idx_property_price on property (cost=0.29..8.45 rows=25) (actual time=0.123..0.789 rows=20 loops=1)
  Index Cond: ((pricepernight >= 100) AND (pricepernight <= 300))
  Filter: (location = 'New York'::text)
Planning Time: 0.089 ms
Execution Time: 0.856 ms
```
